What is Algorithm?
Algorithm is a step by step guide to get solution of a problem. 

E.g.,
Problem: Convert the given length in meters into centimeters and print the length in centimeters.
    Input: Length in meters. (take it as a constant integer value)
    Output: Printed length in centimeters as text "Length in centimeter <value in centimeters>".

Algorithm:
1. Take input (the length in meters) and store it in variable (say, meter).
2. Create a variable (say, centimeter). // It will be storing cm.
3. Calculate this equation (multiply meter by 100) and store it in variable (say, centimeter)
4. Print the string "Length in centimeter "
5. Print value of centimeter.

Code (JS):
<script>
    let meter = 54;
    let centimeter;
    centimeter = meter * 100;

    document.write("<br> Length in centimeter ");
    document.write(centimeter);
</script>

Code (C#):
class program
{
    public static void main()
    {
        int meter = 54;
        int centimeter;
        centimeter = meter * 100;

        Console.Write("Length in centimeter ");
        Console.Write(centimeter);
    }
}

Code (C):

void main()
{
    int meter = 54;
    int centimeter;
    centimeter = meter * 100;

    printf("Length in centimeter ");
    printf("%d", centimeter);
}
