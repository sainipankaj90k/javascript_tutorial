1. Print numbers in Arithmetic progression (AP). 
    AP requires 3 values: initial value (a), common-difference (d), and number of values (n).
    First value a_0 = a
    Second value a_1 = a + d
    Third value a_2 = a + 2*d

    nth value a_n-1 = a + (n-1)*d

    E.g.,
    for initial value 3, common difference 5, number of values as 4, 
    Print: 3, 8, 13, 18

2. Print numbers in Geometric progress (GP)
    initial value (a), common-ratio (r), and number of values (n)

    nth value a_n-1 = a * (r raised to the power (n-1)) = a * (r * r * .. n-1 times)

    E.g., initial value = 3, common ratio = 2, number of values = 4
    Print: 3, 6, 12, 24

3. Print all the digits of a number in reverse order.
    E.g., for number 4356
    Print: 6, 5, 3, 4

4. From years 1 to 2024, print if the year is leap year or not.
    E.g., 
    1 is not a leap year
    2 is not a leap year
    3 is not a leap year
    4 is a leap year
    5 is not a leap year
    ....
    2024 is a leap year

5. Check if a given number is a perfect square or not.
    E.g., 16 = perfect square of 4. 
    Print: 16 is a perfect square.

    E.g., 12 = not a perfect square.
    Print: 12 is not a perfect square.
