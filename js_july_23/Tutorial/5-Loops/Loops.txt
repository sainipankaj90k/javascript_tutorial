Loop statements help iterate over a block of statement repeatedly based on certain condition being true. 

Syntax:

    for( <initialization>; <condition>; <update>)
    {
        // statements.
    }

Execution flow:
step 1: initialization.
step 2: condition check. if true go to step 3 other wize step 6
step 3: execute statement in the block.
step 4: execute udpate step.
step 5: go to step 2
step 6: first like after the loop. 

// Algo:
1. Declare a variable 'a' and assign with value 5.
2. Assign value '10' in variable 'a'.
3. if value of 'a' is greater than '5' then go to step (4) otherwise go to step (8)
4. print string " number is <value of variable 'a'>"
6. assign value of 'a' as one less than current value of 'a'.
7. go to step (3)
8. print string "End of program"

Pseudo code:

{
    let a = 5;

    for(a = 10; a > 5; a = a - 1)
    {
        document.write(" number is " + a);
    }

    document("End of program");
}
