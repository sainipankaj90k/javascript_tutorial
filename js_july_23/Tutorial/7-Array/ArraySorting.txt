What is array sorting?

Sorting is arranging elements of an array in certain order.
E.g., 
    Sorting in ascending order.
    => Implies, next element is always greater than the current element.

    Sorting in descending order.
    => Implies, next element is always smaller than the current element. 

arr: 4, 5, 3
Sort this array in ascending order.

arr: 3, 4, 5

How?

Algorithm: (Selection Sort)
1. Find length of the array and assign it in variable 'len'.
2. Iterate variable 'i' from 0 to len-1
2.1. Find index of sortest element in subarray from index i to len-1, and save it in variable 'smallestIndex'.
2.2. Swap values at index 'i' and index 'smallestIndex'. 


Algorithm: to find smallest number from index 'x' to index 'y' in an array. (x < y)
1. Assign value of array at index 'x' in variable 'smallestNumber'.
2. Assign value of 'x' in variable 'smallestIndex'.
3. Iterate variable 'k' from x + 1, to y. 
3.1. if smallestNumber > arr[k], then assign value of arr[k] to smallestNumber and assign value of k in smallestIndex.
4. return value of 'smallestIndex'

Algorithm: swapping values of two variables 'm' and 'n'.
1. Declare a variable named 'o'.
2. o = n;
3. n = m;
4. m = o;
